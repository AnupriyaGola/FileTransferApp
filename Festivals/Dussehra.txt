Vijayadashami (IAST: Vijayadaśamī, pronounced [ʋɪʝəjəðəʃmɪ]]) also known as Dasara, Dusshera or Dussehra is a major Hindu festival 
celebrated at the end of Navratri every year. It is observed on the tenth day in the Hindu calendar month of Ashvin, the seventh month 
of the Hindu Luni-Solar Calendar, which typically falls in the Gregorian months of September and October.[3][4][5]

Vijayadasami is observed for different reasons and celebrated differently in various parts of the Indian subcontinent.
[6][1][7][3] In the eastern and northeastern states of India, Vijayadashami marks the end of Durga Puja, remembering goddess 
Durga's victory over the buffalo demon Mahishasura to help restore dharma.[3][8] In the northern, southern and western states,
 the festival is synonymously called Dussehra (also spelled Dasara, Dashahara). In these regions, it marks the end of "Ramlila
 " and remembers God Rama's victory over the demon Ravana, or alternatively it marks a reverence for one of the aspects of goddess 
 Devi such as Durga or Saraswati
