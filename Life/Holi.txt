Holi ( /ˈhoʊliː/; Sanskrit: होली Holī) is a Hindu spring festival, originating from India, celebrated predominantly in India
but has also spread to Nepal and many other Western countries, also known as the "festival of colours" or the "festival of love".
[7][1][8] The festival signifies the victory of good over evil, the arrival of spring, end of winter, and for many a festive day to 
meet others, play and laugh, forget and forgive, and repair broken relationships.[9][10] It is also celebrated as a thanksgiving for 
a good harvest.[9][10] It lasts for a night and a day, starting on the evening of the Purnima (Full Moon day) falling in the Vikram 
Samvat Hindu Calendar [11] month of Phalgun, which falls somewhere between the end of February and the middle of March in the Gregorian
calendar. The first evening is known as Holika Dahan or Chhoti Holi and the following day as Holi, Rangwali Holi, Dhuleti, Dhulandi,[12]
or Phagwah.[13]
